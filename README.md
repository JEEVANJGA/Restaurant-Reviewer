# Restaurent Reviewer

The application must include restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours for each restaurant along with reviews, including the name of the reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating system, and comments. The application must include an application header, a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

## Viewing Your Application

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Building Your Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
$ polymer serve build/bundled
```

## Running Tests

$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
